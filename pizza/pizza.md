- 100ml
- 100g of flour, then add about another 30g later
- 5g salt
- 1.25g yeast
- 1.25g honey
- 5g olive oil

## Step 1 - Prep the bases (night before)

- The following makes 8 pizza bases.
- 8 balls, about 230grams per ball, for 12" pizza.

### Step 1.1 - Prep Wet Ingredients

Start with the wet ingredients so has 5 mins headstart.
In a measuring jug on scale add:

1. 750ml water, microwave for 1min
2. 10g yeast (e.g. 5g instant, 5g Italian)
3. 10g honey
4. Leave for 5mins

### Step 1.2 - Prep Dry Ingredients

In mixing bowl on scale:

1. 750g brown flour
2. 40g salt

### Step 1.3 - Autolyse ("auto-lease", french)

1. Add wet to dry ingredients, and give quick stir by hand so doesn't poof in
   the mixer
2. Use the batter attachment to give it a brief mix to combine the ingredients
3. Take off the batter attachment.
4. Leave it for 30mins.

### Step 1.4A - Knead (by machine)

1. Put on the kneading attachment.
2. Slowly add remaining 350g brown flour, up until the right consistency.
3. When it separates from the edge on speed 1, then stop.  
   Note one can add more flour if waiting to separate from the edge on speed 2
   but then it seems a bit dry.
4. Add in olive oil 2mins before the end.
5. Place on table and kneed briefly and form big ball.
6. Leave it for 20 mins to rest.

### Step 1.4B - Knead (by hand)

 TODO:

### Step 1.5 Bag

1. Divide into 8 x balls of about 230grams each.
2. Stuff them in on themselves, to form tight outside edge, and roll into balls.
3. Coat with olive oil and place in sandwich bag with a peg on it.
4. Freeze the rest.

## Step 2. Prep

1. Take pizza's out about 3-4(?)hours before cooking them.
2. Pre-heat oven to hottest temperature your oven can do (without the grill).

## Step 3. Prep Tomato Sauce

Per 340ml can of WHOLE tomatoes add in a mixing bowl:

1. 340ml can of Italian like grade whole tomatoes.
2. Wash your hands (optional, depending on your spouse) then, squash the
   tomatoes with your finger tips.
2. Add 1% salt (3.4g salt) (4g for Graeme).
3. Add an artful swish of olive oil.
4. The correct amount of basil leaves for you.

## Step 4. Prep Cheese

1. Put down that grater
2. Cut (i.e. with a knife) the cheese into thick slices of about 5mm.

## Step 5. Prep bases like an ENFP Engineer who is the son of a German Hippie

Note: Fillus put down your rolling pin! They squash all the air out of the base.

1. Cross finger tips, and squash pizza 3 times by working the air to the edge
   (to form a crust).
2. Turn base over and repeat again.
3. Form pizza by working it as little as possible with the pads of your fingers
   (not finger tips).
4. Stretch it out if required.
5. If your oven can't reach 500 degrees Celsius, we going to have to pre cook
   the bases with no toppings first. Pop the base in the oven, and lets check in about 5 mins?
   Turn it over to cook the other side.
6. Mean can prep the next base.
7. Cook all the pizza bases.

## Step 6. Add topping and cook again

1. Add a "scoop'ah'roo" of tomato source in the middle, and swish about.
2. Add the lekker thuck slices of cheese with a wee bit of social distancing
   between them.
3. Add olives, and any other topping you wish, except banana or pineapple, just no.
4. Brush olive oil around the crust so that the part without the tomato sauce
   doesn't burn.
5. Slide it into the oven.
6. Scoop it out 5min(?? Maybe we can add some real number to these values
   after the exercise) later.

## Step 7 Eat!

1. Divide the pizza into 45 degree pie slices.
2. Pick up a slice along the perimeter with your hand you are most co-ordinated
   with, likely your right (right when facing forward, forward being the side
   with your eyes, if you don't have eyes the side with your nose, if you don't
   have a nose the side with your ... you get the idea?).
3. In a smooth arc bring the pizza slice with smallest interior angle towards
   your mouth.
4. Ensure lips are parted a minimum of 20mm (+/-5 depending on your teeth height).
5. Engage your jaw muscles to repetitively raise and lower your jaw bone, to
   which are attached your teeth which will effectively unassemble the pizza
   you have just assembled. Use your tongue to unassemble the pizza in a more
   dynamic fashion.
6. When you the "feel" the sensation of the pizza standing eagerly at the top of
   the playground slide and ready to go, send it on its way by contracting the
   muscles along your oesophagus in a travelling wave downwards, note: depending
   on your orientation you may need to adjust the direction of the travelling
   wave, the main point is that it is towards the digestive stomach.
7. Rub your belly with a feeling of satisfaction that can only come from the
   dopamine rush from digesting excessive amounts of cheese and carbs.
8. Have another slice!
9. Thank you fellow human being for engaging in this pizza assembling and
   consumption task.

## MEDIA BACKUPS

- Anki does not back up your media files
(I think this means it saves it, but not versioned backups like what is does with your cards).
(although will be synced on your phone etc.)
- Periodically backup:
  - `%APPDATA%\Anki2\...\collection.media` or
  - `C:\Users\Michael\scoop\persist\anki\data\User 1\collection.media` if using scoop
  - to
  - `D:\Dropbox\Apps\Anki`

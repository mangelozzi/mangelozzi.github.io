## Identify Stroke

Need to get person who has had a stroke (falled down etc) to a doctor within 3 hrs...
Now doctors say a bystander can recognize a stroke by asking him/he these simple questions:
1 - S *SMILE.
2 - T *TALK and SPEAK A SIMPLE SENTENCE (Coherently)
3 - R *RAISE BOTH ARMS.
4 - S *Stick out Tongue, If the tongue is 'crooked', if it goes to one side or the other that is also an indication of a stroke.

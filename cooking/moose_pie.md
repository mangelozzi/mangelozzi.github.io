# MOOSE PIE

## Ingredients

Makes 10 individual chicken pies.

- Chicken breasts 6-8
- 300g off peas and corn frozen mix (I use this to help bulk up the mixture)
- 2x Woolworths Chicken soup in a can/tin (400g)
- Flour - about 2 tablespoons
- Milk - about 1 cup
- Butter - about 2 tablespoons
- Mushrooms (1 or 2 punnets)
- 1~2 teaspoons of wholegrain mustard
- Mixed herbs and origanum
- Sprig of time
- Onions x2
- 2 x puff pastry
- 2 x shortcut pastry
- Aluminium containers (I buy from the plastic shop in lilly quarter)

Method:

1. Cut up the chicken into cubes and finely dice the onions, cook onion in oil or butter then once transparent add the chicken to cook (lid on to keep tender)
2. While that's on the go start making your sauce in a separate pot. Make a basic white sauce (butter, milk and flour). Once smooth add the 2 chicken soup and mix.
3. Add your herbs (use own discretion, I use about a heaped teaspoon of each) and add about 1 to 2 heaped teaspoons of the wholegrain mustard along with salt and pepper to your sauce.
4. By this point your chicken should be cooked now add your chopped mushrooms (I use 1 punnet but can use more if want more mushroom taste). Allow for the water to cook away.
5. Add your Peas and corn to the sauce. Taste and add more herbs/salt and pepper/mustard if required.
6. Once the chicken and mushrooms water has basically disappeared add your sauce to the chicken and mushrooms.
7. Allow to simmer for 5 minutes or so to make sure the taste of the chicken and mushrooms also infiltrate into the sauce.
8. Leave to cool.
9. Once cooled, poke holes into your aluminium dish at the bottom and spray them with spray and cook /similar.
10. Roll out your short crust pastry (I usually get about 5 aluminium tins per roll of pastry) and lay it in the aluminium dish so the pastry goes up the sides.
Add your tasty chicken mix (I do one kinda heaped ladle per pie) and then add the puff pastry on top.
The puff pastry you cant roll as thin as the short crust cause then it doesn't go as flakey. But again you can probably get about 5 tins per roll.
Place on top and using a fork squeeze the two pastries together to ensure when it cooks all the goodness doesn't ooze out the side. Poke holes and pop on lid and place in freezer!

And enjoy!
